# Course App

## Description

The Course App is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides a platform for users to register, login, and logout, access course services, and contact the admin. The app includes features like Zod validation for input data and JWT (JSON Web Token) verification for user authentication. Additionally, there's an admin panel that allows the admin to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the course data.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can register, login, and logout securely.
- Course services: Users can access course information pulled from the database.
- Contact admin: Users can send messages to the admin for inquiries or support.
- Zod validation: Input data is validated using Zod for improved data integrity.
- JWT verification: JSON Web Tokens are used for user authentication and authorization.
- Admin panel: Admins have access to CRUD operations for managing course data.
